## Description
Velociraptor is an open source endpoint monitoring tool developed by Velocidex Enterprises. Velociraptor provides the next generation in endpoint visibility with a solid architecture, a library of customisable forensic artefacts and its own unique and flexible query language all in a free and open source tool.

## Purpose
Velociraptor is a powerful endpoint monitoring tool that includes the ability to execute many of complex forensic actions (e.g. taking memory images, creating a filesystem timeline) from a single console. I highly recommend checking out their website to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this powerful tool's capabilities: https://www.velocidex.com/

## Configuration Details
* The Velociraptor console is installed on Logger
* The agent is installed on all 3 Windows hosts

## Data Location
